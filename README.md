 by typing any number it changes from free to taken, simple right? 
That were exactly my toughts befor deciding dive a little deeper.As you can see it has a little description filed what you can do with the function, Im gonna cover the most complicated in my objection. I thought like what if someno gives me a call and wants a table for tonight? Whats happening then? So thats why I created functionalitie for booking a table for today, working with real time and date:






\, and another one, that lets you reserve tables for future dates like tommorow or noext week, basicly whenever you want. Both your reservations and bookings are collected in different list, and when the date is todays date, the table automaticly becomes booked.
